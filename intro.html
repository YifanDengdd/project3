        <li><strong>Kunming:</strong>The city I lived</li>  
        <li>Kunming, also known as Yunnan-Fu, is the capital and largest city of Yunnan province, China. It is the political, economic, communications and cultural centre of the province as well as the seat of the provincial government. The headquarters of many of Yunnan's large businesses are in Kunming. It was important during World War II as a Chinese military center, American air base, and transport terminus for the Burma Road. In the middle of the Yunnanâ€“Guizhou Plateau, Kunming is at an altitude of 1,900 metres (6,234 feet) above sea level and a latitude just north of the Tropic of Cancer. As of 2020 census, Kunming had a total population of 8,460,088. As of the 2018 estimation, its urban population was 4,089,100. And its built-up (or metro) area made of all urban districts but Jinning, not conurbated yet, was home to 3,779,900 inhabitants. It is at the northern edge of Dian Lake, surrounded by temples and lake-and-limestone hill landscapes. </li>
